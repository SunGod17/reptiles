        <p>
        Before I can give you the specifics of each reptile there are a few general rules you should be aware
        of. There are certain basic items you will expect to need. Here are the basic things you'll need.<br>
        <u> I will also be covering price in the description of the reptile not in the basic description.</u>               
        </p>
        <h3>An Enclosure</h3>
        <p>
        Most reptiles are cold blooded meaning they're going to need a specific area that can deliver them the 
        proper habitat. Depending on the type of reptile you have you made need to get different types of 
        enclosures. Don't worry too much though, an enclosure can be as simple as a repurposed fish tank. I 
        will be more specific about the type of enclosure you need when talking about the reptile.
        </p>
        <h3>Substrate</h3>
        <p>
        Substrate is the flooring of the enclosure. Depending on where your reptile comes from it may need a dry
        substrate or a moist subsrate. You can think of substrate in an enclosure similar to woodchips in a 
        playground.
        </p>
        <h3>Heating</h3>
        <p>
        As I meantioned earlier Reptiles are cold blooded, this means they are unable to regulate their own body 
        tempurature. Heating can come in defferent forms. There are <u>heating pads</u> and <u>Heating bulbs</u>.
        Again I will be more specific on what you will need in the repitle description.
        </p>
        <h3>Humidity</h3>
        <p>
        This is a very important factor when considering the type of enclosure and substrate you will need. Reptiles 
        are unable to regulate the moisture in their skin. Also depending on the type of Reptile you may need a higher 
        or lower humidty enviorment. An example would be if the reptile is coming from a desert-like enviorment they 
        will need a dry substrate and low humidty. However a reptilr that's coming from a rainforest-like enviorment 
        they will need a moist substrate and higher humidity. You may want to cosider a humidity box which is a DIY 
        project. I would suggest this because it is alot cheaper than a fog machine or moist substrate. If this does 
        intrest you click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS8gZXXK7S4">HERE</a> to learn how to make one.
        </p>
        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
         This is very important because different reptiles eat different things. For example some eat bugs, some eat
         fish, others eat rodents(Mice or Rats). Therefore it's very important to consider these things. Another thing
         you will need to consider is whether or not you're willing to feed live some reptiles will need live mice or 
         live fish.
        </p>
        <h3>Reptile Hide</h3>
        <P>
        This is something similar to a cave. The basic purpose of this is to give your reptile a small dark place in 
        order to make them feel safe. It's similar to how humans have a bed and dogs have a cage. It's just a space 
        where they can sleep and feels safe.
        </P>
