       <p>
           <b>Description:</b>
           The garter snake is a great starter reptile especially if you want a snake. It's small, skinny and <B><u>NON-VENOMOUS!</u></B>
           This means if it bites you you'll be A-Okay. Garter snakes are great because they have a good appetite and are dinural creatures
           awake by day and asleep by night. They're also very affordable and cool with multiple different morfs. All in all it's a great 
           first reptile pet.

        <b>What They Eat:</b>
         Garter snakes <u>eat fish</u>, they can survive on worms and crickets but in order for them to get all their nutrition they need fish or mice.
         However due to snakes size finding mice the right size will be challanging also mice are pretty gross to feed to snake. I'd say you're
         better off buying raw Salmon, Tilapia or Sunfish and feeding it to them in small pieces about the size of their head. However it is very
         important to feed  them fish that has fully thawed and at room tempurature. If you prefer a live option you can feed them live minnos 
         which you should be able to find at a local petshop. Just make sure to call ahead to ask if their minnos are safe to eat and let them 
         know you're planning to feed it to a snake.

       <h3>Leopard Gecko </h3>

       <P>
       <B>Description:</B> The Leopard Gecko is another great first reptile pet. It is small, affordable and pretty easy to take care of. The Leopard Gecko
       is <u><b>Non-Venomous.</b></u> However they are nocturnal meaning they sleep during the day and are wake at night. Therefore when you see them during the day they 
       wont be very active. It also means any escape that may happen will happen at night so keep that in mind.
